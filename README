Proof-of-concept tool to take measurements with the kinect. 



Batch Experiment Version
------------------------
You need to get a dataset from Tom's dropbox. It should be in the current directory as 'data/'.

Run the script with
  python measure_dataset.py



Interactive Version
-------------------
Run the script with
  python clickmeasure.py


Hopefully you'll see a live preview of the depth image. Click on two points - a measurement will be displayed. The measurement is made by sampling the depth image in the [-10,10] neighborhood of each point, and taking the mean. The depth sample and x,y location are projected using a default intrinsic calibration matrix to produce points in (metric) world space.

The boxes indicate the width of the 'sample area' around each selected point. 


I like to uncomment the 'go()' at the bottom (and also replace cv.WaitKey() with pylab.waitforbutonpress()) and run the script with ipython -pylab. Doing it this way, you can interrupt the loop with ^C, poke around at the global variables, depth, rgb, etc., then start it again by typing go().
